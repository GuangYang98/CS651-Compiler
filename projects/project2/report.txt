3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Multiline Comment): This problem is not hard, just modify the 
   code in Scanner to scan through the multiline comment.

   Problem 2 (Reserved Words): This problem is straightforward which can be solved
   by adding the reserved word to the TokenInfo and Scanner. The trick is you have
   to put the reserved word in the hashtable in Scanner.

   Problem 3 (Operators): Add the operators to the TokenInfo and modify some
   parts in Scanner can support the demanded operators.
   
   Problem 4 (Separators): Add the colon to the TokenInfo and modify the Scanner
   to support the colon.

   Problem 5 (Literals): This problem is challenging, for it's required to finished
   without regular expressions. I add much code in the Scanner to perform the
   same operation as the regular expressions stated in the problem set.
