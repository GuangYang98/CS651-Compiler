3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Long and Double Basic Types):
   At first I try to add the code into the Paser.java and Type.java, but there
   is still bugs and the output is not right. Eventually, I discover there is
   a descriptorFor() function which need to insert the class descriptor. But,
   there is no instruction about it. I search on Google and find this link:
   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2
   The lack of instruction made me struggle for a long time in this question.

   Problem 2 (Operators): 
   Just follow the assignment to insert the code to different operator class.
   The || operator take me a while to figure out how to implement the short-
   circuited logic.

   Problem 3 (Conditional Expression): 
   This problem is much harder, I have to manually construct the class from
   JExpression to handle the conditionalExpression. However, for this project,
   we don't need to implement the codegen function. Or, I will spend more
   time on it.

   Problem 4 (Switch Statement): 
   This problem is pretty hard. There is rarely any instruction. And I have
   to mimic how the code is orangized to build up some class to deal with the
   switchBlockStatementGroup and output something as instructor's AST. Luckily,
   right now, we don't need to do the codegen part. OR, it will be a disaster.

   Problem 5 (Do-While Statement): 
   This one is not hard, I can reuse a lot of code from the while statement.

   Problem 6 (For Statement):
   After finishing the problem above, I have already gained some experience on
   how to write the code to process these statements. I use some time to finish
   this part.

   Problem 7 (Exception Handlers):
   At first, I only implement the throw support code, and then the result failed.
   Then I found out there is also a throws resevered word. Then I need to
   code something to support the memberDeclaration.

   Problem 8 (Interface Type Declaration): 
   I just mimic the code form the classDeclaration and finished the implement of
   interfaceDeclaration. However, I didn't realize that the classDeclaration
   misses the implements support. After finish it, the result seems good.

4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
