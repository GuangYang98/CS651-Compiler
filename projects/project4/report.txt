3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Part I (Additions to JavaCC Scanner)

   Problem 1 (Multiline Comment):
   Although this problem is very straightforward, I spent much time on it
   because the grammar of the regular expression doesn't support multi character
   in []. Finally, I solved this problem by using the state transfer.

   Problem 2 (Reserved Words): 
   This one is straightforward.

   Problem 3 (Operators):
   This should be easy.
   
   Problem 4 (Separators):
   It's easy.

   Problem 5 (Literals): 
   It's not hard.

   Part II (Additions to JavaCC Parser)
   
   Problem 6 (Long and Double Basic Types): 
   With JavaCC, to add the support to the basic types is not hard.

   Problem 7 (Operators):
   This problem is not that hard, however, it took much time to finish
   the coding. There are too many operators.
   
   Problem 8 (Conditional Expression):
   This one seems not very hard to solve, but it took times.

   Problem 9 (Switch Statement):
   It cost much time on it to modify the previous code to fit in the JavaCC.

   Problem 10 (Do-While Statement): 
   This one is not hard.

   Problem 11 (For Statement):
   This one is not hard.

   Problem 12 (Exception Handlers):
   This one is not hard, but require time and workload.

   Problem 13 (Interface Type Declaration): 
   It cost much time on it to modify the previous code to fit in the JavaCC.
